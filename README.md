# :bar_chart: Live Stats
A way to follow league games live without having to tune in the stream.

Live Stats is a page that allows you to keep up with live League of Legends games without having to watch the stream thanks to the live updating UI and minimap. 

This repository contains the source code for Live Stats.

## Development

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

During development, you can use `npm start` to start a webserver at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). This webserver uses Hot Module Reloading to automatically refresh the UI whenever a file is edited.
